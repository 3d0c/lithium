#### Special syntax

Views have a special syntax for outputting escaped text. The standard way to
output escaped text in your views from Lithium is as follows: {{{
<?=$variable;?>
}}}

This is where a lot of confusion comes in because it is commonly misunderstood
that Lithium depends on `short_open_tags`, however, that's not the case. The
contents of a view is processed through a [ stream](template/view/Stream) before
it is included by PHP. See the PHP [ manual](http://www.php.net/streams) to learn
more about streams.

The stream wrapper reads the file and searches for anything that looks like
`<?=...?>` and replaces it with `<?php echo $h(...); ?>`.

The design decision behind using PHP's short echo syntax is because it's a
familiar syntax and it helps developers focus more on what data _should not_ be
escaped vs. what data _needs_ to be escaped.

**Note:** `$h()` is the HTML escape function used in views.

**Note:** To output regular, unescaped text, use plain old `<?php echo ...; ?>`.
